I write about current ongoings in AI, industry news and topics that I find interesting in my AI newsletter - [The Layman's Guide to AI](nirajpandkar.substack.com)

In 2021, my friend and I built a Cartoonizer app which turns images and videos into animated pictures/cartoons. We gained 12,000 users in the first week and served it to 150,000 unique users till 2023. I've written about the tech in this [Medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-we-built-an-inexpensive-scalable-architecture-to-cartoonize-the-world-8610050f90a0).

In the final year of my Master's, I set out with a mission to predict and construct a person's face from only a DNA sample to help criminal investigations. All the significant efforts have been published in my IEEE paper - [3D Facial Biometric Verification Using a DNA Sample for Law Enforcement Applications](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10102080)
